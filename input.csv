1786,Products,iDeposit Origination,"HORIZON integrated Deposit Origination provides a fully automated workflow for the setup of all new deposit accounts The design of iDO eliminates all redundant storage and/or maintenance of products and interest rates, as iDO is a holistic extension of the HORIZONTM Banking System. Product and interest rate changes are available to iDO as soon as they are initiated in the central bank control records. Features  Account origination  The cornerstone of iDO is the Session Manager workflow engine, which guides a user through the origination process based on internal policies and controls. Complete audit logs of all activities occurring in the new account workflow are contained and stored in a Sales Session within iDO.   Customer validation  Customer validation is tightly interfaced to the FISTM New AccountChexSM, QualiFileSM, ID VerificationSM, Address AnalysisSM, Red Flag Checklist and OFAC WatchSM modules. The customer validation requests launch automatically during the session workflow, eliminating any redundant population of customer information. Real-time results are returned in the iDO workflow, enabling your new account representative to determine customer eligibility prior to transitioning into product selection. Additionally, full interfaces are available to the TransUnion and Experian credit bureaus.   eSignature functionality  iDO offers you the ability to install electronic signature pads at your customer service workstations. Customers can then review their documents on a monitor and sign them either one at a time or collectively. This helps the environment by eliminating the need to print paper copies of customer documents. It also helps your bottom line by reducing paper, printing and document disposal costs. Document storage is also streamlined, since signed documents are automatically indexed and stored in HORIZON ALLView, FIS Document Management, or FIS Vision Content document imaging modules.    Product selection  iDO provides users with a consolidated view of all deposit, safe deposit box and debit card products. During the product selection process, Product Presentations provide the ability to view marketing collateral in the form of HTML, PDF or Word documents or, when appropriate, to launch a bank-defined Internet page.   Recommended products feature  iDO preselects products based on the customer meeting bank-defined criteria. In addition, clients taking advantage of the HORIZON Profitability Analysis application can cross-sell products based on a customers profitability tier ranking. Recommendations are made for both personal and non-personal customers and are based on a customers current month or historical profitability tier ranking. Rounding out this feature is a robust interface to FIS Connections CRM Recommended Products and Referral Tracking.  Complementary products feature  This feature triggers the automatic addition of products into the new account session. When a triggering product is selected for origination from the Product Selection screen, the complementary products are automatically added to the selection list. This is an excellent method to promote cross-sales of specific products, such as debit or ATM cards.  Check ordering  The check ordering process is launched automatically at the conclusion of the new account workflow. iDO provides check ordering interfaces to Deluxe, Harland Clarke and Main Street Checks. All relevant customer and account data is passed to the check vendor, and the entire check ordering process is performed within the vendors Internet application. Check re-orders are managed by launching the same streamlined workflow from an existing account.

2149,Products,ATMMISERNet,"ATM-Online (ATMMISERNet) This application is powerful, yet easily maintained. It provides an interface between ATM devices and networks and the MISER database, and functions as both an online and offline system. It enables a financial institution to process customer card transactions from proprietary, non-proprietary (through a switch), and/or point-of-sale devices. As an online system, it verifies proprietary ATM and switch requests against MISER account records. The ATMMISERnet system also relays transaction information to other MISER applications for posting to the appropriate accounts. Note: Switch transactions originate from devices on regional, national, and international networks and proprietary devices link directly to the institution. Reliability Stand-in processing and independent operation permit reliable access at all times. Customers can access their accounts even when the host financial institution is offline to MISER. When communications are disrupted (offline), ATMMISERnet permits stand-in processing by devices or switches, if they are off-host-capable. The MISER database (MISDB) is accessed for processing; if unavailable, the application switches to the ATM database (ATMDB) so that authorization and processing of transactions can continue. When communications is restored, the application returns the device or switch to online status and automatically requests the stored transactions for processing through the MISER transaction processor (TPSL). The ability of the application to operate independently (offline to TPSL) aids your financial institution in functions such as end-of-day processing. During normal operation (online), the application maintains a dynamically updated database of account balances.ATMMISERnet also provides the means to manage activity and balances while the institution is offline performing its nightly update.

10205,Applications,Bankway Teller Capture,"Teller Capture provides your staff with the ability to image-capture and balance deposits at the teller station. Tellers accept checks and deposit slips and run them through a check reader, which instantly extracts the deposit account number from the MICR data.   As each check is processed through the reader, the system applies highly optimized courtesy and legal amount recognition, so the teller almost never keys in the check amount. Our solution matches the unique MICR of every check with its given amount, adds the value of all checks presented, and makes sure that it corresponds with the total deposit on the deposit slip. Teller Capture automates the creation of virtual tickets for non-scanned items, such as cash-in and cash-out tickets.   Teller Capture provides your institution with the capability to image-capture checks at the teller station  extending back room capture and balancing into the branch. With Teller Capture, your teller staff will combine traditional online teller transaction processing with check image capture and transaction balancing.   Teller Capture can be deployed as a stand-alone solution, or as a strategic component of an enterprise-wide distributed capture infrastructure. When paired with Branch Capture, it provides optimum teller efficiency by serving low-volume retail customers at the teller line, as well as high-volume merchants and corporate clients at the back counter.   Teller Capture applies DREAM (Dynamic Reject Entry Automation Module) technology on all check images at capture. Our DREAM solution automatically repairs the MICR line on each check real-time and returns them to the normal processing stream in less than a second.

6004,Services,Item Processing - Check Image (Remote Required),"HORIZON Third-party Interfaces: Item Processing - Check Image  Check Imaging is fully integrated into HORIZON processing. In addition to FISs ImageCentre and Vision IP, imaging supports the following other vendors: Bysis/DSI, GG Pulley, FiServ and Wausau.   The imaging vendor captures images during the capture run on the sorter. Once captured, the images are used for reject repair. When the run is extracted for transmission to the AS/400, the statement images are written to a posting file and the transactions are then sent to the AS/400 to be processed. During BOSS processing, the exception file, items that did not post during BOSS and the cycle file, cycle records for accounts that had transactions post, are created. If there is a statement cycle during this run, the standard enclosure count file for statements is created. The statement text (spool) file is also produced and written to the image text file in the supported vendor-specified format. The recon detail file is also produced at this time and contains records for every item that should be enclosed with the statement.    Once BOSS processing is complete, the vendor specific files are downloaded. Included in the downloaded files is the NSF/OD notice text file. The NSF/OD notice text file is almost identical to the statement text and recon file in format. The NSF/OD notice file is produced after online Return Item Processing (RIP) is completed.   A repost file is also created and downloaded to the vendor. This file contains reversals that were processed through BOSS. The repost file is used to flag the images as paid or not paid and is very similar to the return/revert file. The return/revert file and repost files both contain changed transactions. Another file produced during BOSS is the CIF/Account Information file.

The current list of off-the-shelf components (formats) include: * ATM - Diebold Transaction Generator * ATM - Nautilus Hyosung Transaction Generator * ATM - NCR Transaction Generator * ATM - Triton Transaction Generator * ATM - Tidel Transaction Generator * AMEX GCAG * AMEX GNS * APACS 30 * C-TAP Terminal * C-TAP Acquier 11 * DCI Express (Diners) * Discover ISO * EIS1080 * EPOC ISO 8583 (Fiserv) * FIS ISO PIISO (DE55 or 3rd Bitmap) * JCB JLink-9 * LIS5 ISO * mada * MasterCard Credit * MasterCard Debit * nexo-IS 4.0 Acquirer Testing * nexo-IS 4.0 POI Testing * NYCE ISO * PULSE ISO * Shazam ISO * STAR ISO (STAR NE merged) * TSYS ISO 8583 * UnionPay International * Visa DPS * VisaNet Authorization-Only * Visa SMS ATM * Visa SMS Interlink * Visa SMS ISO  (other formats are available as custom solutions). The sales focus is on automation and regression - the test tools allow customers to quickly create and run tests, reusing tests for regression. The test tool is often used at both sides of a customer host to simulate and test the acquired transactions as well as the transaction authorization from a payment network or issuer. The test tool connects directly to host systems or terminals (such as POS, ATM, mPOS, etc). Off-the-shelf formats are updated in advance of payment network mandate cycles so customers may quality test with automation before releasing new payment network interfaces into production. Simulators include the business rules of the specific formats, it is generally up to the customer to add their specific test cases on top of standard validations like field validations, message content checks and inter-message rules. Terminal test plans for EMV pre-certification and certification are available off the shelf for the major brands. The simulators are used most often as functional test systems for positive and negative transaction testing. High performance (and high connection count for ATM+POS) capacity testing solutions are also available based on the same software platform. Settlement file generation and testing is also available - this works in conjunction with logs generated from the functional test tool which is then used to generate and store the authorization messages.http://www.fisglobal.com/ucmprdpub/groups/public_searchable/documents/webasset/c038953.pdf",11578,"Agnieszka Szymanska,Greg Smith",Active,Business-to-Business and Money Movement,Enterprise Payments Retail,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

Profile Teller allows Tellers to process transactions in a single currency or multicurrency environment, with or without value dates, with the capability to access multiple teller posting screens based on their job requirements. The system processes transactions entered online in a real-time environment, updating the database immediately to reflect the transaction while simultaneously validating all transactions during data entry. When tellers post transactions in Profile, the system checks for restrictions on all accounts entered on the posting screen, rejecting the entire set of transaction if a restriction is detected. FIS Profile enables users to override restrictions on customer accounts, which can be limited by an organization to separate authorized user privileges based on the user's authorization clearance level. Profile Teller also allows an organization to determine overrides and/or restrictions based on the transaction code in use. Profile Teller enables the organization to track the balance (of all currencies) currently in a teller's drawer. Profile aids tellers in tracking documents generated or collected during transaction processing, periodically generating lists for each type of document, and forwarding the documents and lists to the organization's proof department for reconcilement purposes. FIS Profile fully supports both teller balancing and branch processing by monitoring the total cash amount as users post transactions.

Additional schemes that are scheduled for certification in 2023 are: JCB, MADA (Debit). It is available as a software licence or an FIS Hosted solution. It includes the 3-D Secure Server for the merchant environment, and webSDK. Optional mobile SDKs are also available. -- As digital commerce grows, an increasing number of online and mobile payment methods are becoming available making identity verification more complicated than ever before. 3DS v2.0 is a new standard introduced by EMVCo wherein a new approach to authentication is employed to protect against payment fraud and provide an improved online experience. The WebPaySecure 3DS Server solution is a 3DS v2.0 implementation for the Acquirer domain which within the 3DS ecosystem includes the merchant, payment gateway and acquiring banks. These entities initiate the authentication but in order to do so, need to deploy an end-to-end application that can communicate with the Schemes and the Issuing banks. In essence, the 3DS Server facilitates communication between the 3DS Requestor and the Schemes thereby replacing the Merchant Server Plug-in (MPI) component from earlier implementations. By using WebPaySecure 3DS Server for authentication prior to authorisation, entities in the Acquirer domain will enjoy a range of benefits that include but are not limited to - Shift in fraud liability from merchant to issuer - Usage of more secure and user-friendly authenticators, such as one-time passwords (OTPs) and biometrics as opposed to static passwords - Rich data exchange to help prevent fraud and reduce friction from a customer experience perspective - Enhanced conversions with reduction in friction during payments - Smoother and consistent user experience across devices Primary features of WebPaySecure 3DS Server include - EMVCo Certified confirming adherance to the latest protocol (v2.2.0) along with backward compatibility to all active protocols - Scheme Certified for all major schemes including Visa Secure, Mastercard Identity Check and American Express SafeKey - PSD2 Compliant after passing Visa's PSD2 test cases ensuring the mandatory Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirement is met for European markets - Enhanced User Experience for a consistent checkout experience across browsers and mobile apps - Highly Adaptable with frameworks in place to support an international solution - Ready to Plug-In Architecture built on the latest technology with security and controls - Device Agnostic supporting browser authentication as well as native mobile SDKs for iOS and Android - Cloud Enabled with microservices architecture providing high availability - Highly Scalable ensuring authentication volumes can be handled as per customer requirements - Hosted and In-House options available (as per regional requirements) to cater for deployment needs",0,James Su,Active,International Solutions,Card Solutions - Intl,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

Recovering data requires identifying appropriate media and transporting them to the place where they would be restored, either to an operations center or to a disaster recovery site. Again, risk is increased and valuable time is wasted. Vaulting presents the option to move backups to a storage server where everything is encrypted from the point it exits the System to at-rest encryption on a storage server. The backups are off site almost immediately and may be restored as simply as any physical media backup.

12249,Services,Predictive Metrics,"PredictiveMetrics bundled with GETPAID, or added as a subscription to GETPAID, solution helps companies move beyond powerful automated strategies driven by aging and balance to to an even higher level of collection productivity and effectiveness, through the direct prediction of collection risk. Knowing collection risk gets to the root of the collectors focus. Some delinquent accounts are going to cure with a reminder email or without even a touch, while others, even just slightly delinquent accounts, should get that phone call now. PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring provides the likelihood that an on-going business customer will pay their current outstanding obligations over the near future, typically next 6 months, in a severely delinquent manner or not at all and the Cash at Risk (CAR) for that business given this prediction of severe delinquency or no payment. With this predictive intelligence companies can allocate their scarce collection resources over their large portfolio of accounts, as well as determine the type, e.g. email or call, and degree, e.g. reminder call or demanding call. Companies also can use the collection risk assessment as input to new order release or credit line changes and use CAR as input to loss reserve modeling. To obtain PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring a company first needs to provide historical data. The data necessary for PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring is available from the GETPAID system if client has been using GETPAID already for 18 or more months. Otherwise data is available, as identified by our detailed data request, from any account receivable system. Once PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring has been calibrated to the payment behavior of the companies customers than ongoing month end data directly from GETPAID is extracted to update the collection scoring to reflect their customers most recent behavior. The update collection scoring information is then imported into GETPAID and the collection score risk based prioritizations and strategies are then updated to steer the collectors to the right accounts at the right time with the most effective strategies. The data exchange between the business and PredictiveMetrics is done through secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) Features Leverages internal data for predictive analysis so the purchase of incremental third party data is not required Collection scoring outputs are probability of severe delinquency, score, 0.01 to 100, risk class assignment as determined by score, CAR, top three reasons for why the score did not score higher Can be applied to any business financing type; trade, leasing, loans, credit cards and others, covering all types of lenders; companies selling product or service under trade terms, banks and non-bank financial firms, utilities and others",12171,"Daniel Tantum,Sean Daley",Active,Business-to-Business and Money Movement,Receivables,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

The platform, which works by identifying suspicious activity and risky behavior patterns, employs predictive models and allows for user-defined business rules to uncover the many forms and variations of identity-related fraud.  New-Account Fraud Increases in data breaches, identity theft, and fullz are among the factors contributing to the rise in new-account fraud. New-account fraud (NAF) can negatively affect institutions in the following ways:  Fraud losses: 1.33 percent of all new accounts are fraudulent. (Javelin, 2018) DDA NAF is projected to increase by 79 percent by the year 2020. (Javelin, 2017), Lost revenue: Insufficient data and analytics, plus the absence of new-account inquiry information specific to retail banking, is a recipe for false-positives. This leads to an unnecessarily clumsy experience where accounts are put on hold and honest customers are required to provide additional evidence to prove their identity. Costly manual reviews: When screening is not accurate, investigators waste time investigating accounts that are unlikely to be fraudulent.   Solution - Screen all new accounts with FraudChex to assess the risk of fraud.  The FraudChex platform uses the most comprehensive database of DDA fraud-behavior history to predict which interactions, variables, and behaviors are indicative of fraud.   How it Works:  1.  New-account information is sent via batch or real-time to the FraudChex platform, 2. FraudChex-NAF examines hundreds of data attributes seeking out-of-pattern behavior related to identities, crime dynamics, previous fraud activity, and previous new account inquiries, 3.The new account is assigned a fraud risk score, 4 The score and information on suspicious behavior are sent to the online case-management system, allowing investigators to quickly stop criminal activity before it becomes costly.",0,Nick White,Active,Decision Solutions,Decision Solutions,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

15054,Services,Enhanced Claims Elimination,"The first component of this product is Ethoca Eliminator.  As cardholders call our dispute center to initiate a fraud dispute, FIS agents can get detailed information from the merchant regarding the details of the purchase such as delivery address, username, purchase details, and device name from which the purchase was made.  After the purchase information is reviewed with the cardholder and they maintain that the transaction is fraud, the merchant will communicate the actions that will be taken if the dispute is filed.  For example, the merchant might state they will remove the purchase from the device or disable the account.  By providing additional information and the consequences of continuing the dispute, FIS will be able to deflect 1st Party and family fraud claims from entering the dispute process which creates unnecessary financial loss for the financial institution.      The second component is the Ethoca Alerts product.  This process allow FIS to send disputes as they are raised directly to the merchant.  The merchant will then have the opportunity to provide an expedited resolution to the dispute by issuing credit directly to the cardholder's account.  In some cases such as low dollar items, 3D Secure, and Verified by VISA transactions, the merchant will issue credit to the cardholder which provides additional recoveries that are not available today in the standard chargeback process.  In other situations upon receipt of the dispute, the merchant will issue credit to the cardholder's account to resolve the dispute.  During our production pilot merchants resolved these disputes in an average of 14 hours.

Again, risk is increased and valuable time is wasted. Vaulting presents the option to move backups to a storage server where everything is encrypted from the point it exits the System to at-rest encryption on a storage server.

GCI can be used to pass activities and changed positions to Global One as a stream, and also to expose critical Global One data to other systems on a message basis. GCI is used in conjunction with the import/export capabilities already provided in Global One via AIM (Activities Interface Module) and GOSOS (Global One Standard Output System). The underlying data content and validations supported by AIM and GOSOS are utilised by GCI, however the messages are transferred on a real time basis rather than by batch file transfer. If the link to Global One is being developed for a web environment (internet or extranet), the e-GO module should be considered as an alternative to AIM and GCI as this enables the Global One functionality to be accessed through the Global One object model.	12949	Elliot Tricker	Active	Trading and Processing	SSF Software	2023-06-22	NULL	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	NULL

This module enables the financial institution to track monetary activity including payments, collection activity and special conditions of the account and/or borrower with seamless integration with the core HORIZON lending and deposit applications. This application provides direct access to the Banks loan, deposit, and customer account information.   Collections Management screens are designed to give a consistent look and feel. The HORIZON Customer Collections Portfolio Screen may be accessed using various information including customer name, social security number, and account number. From this screen a user or collector can see all accounts in Collections for a particular customer. Also included is a scratchpad feature that allows the user to enter permanent notes to an account visible on the main Collection screen.   The system includes collection queue processing and reporting for DDA and savings accounts with debit balance active and charged-off accounts. This works similarly to the way the loan, mortgage, and ready reserve accounts process with the collection application.   Integrated Collections Management notes are integrated with HORIZONs Relationship Management notes. HORIZON function security is used within the system which allows the Bank to secure collections related notes and add collections alerts. The system uses the Central Lookup File for Reason, Risk, Bankruptcy, and Collection Codes.   Work order may be defined at Queue or Bank Level. Collections queue balancing feature allows banks to use the same loan selection criteria for multiple queues to balance collector workload. The system displays all critical information necessary for the collections effort on the main collection screen. Also displayed is a reminder feature similar to that found in Microsoft Outlook that reminds collectors to follow up on accounts at specific times throughout the day.   Collections incorporate a report control for generation of reports, letters, and notices. Reports generated in the system provide detailed collections analysis statistics for management review and analysis including such information as promises broken and kept.   Information in iCollections Management is consolidated, streamlined, reliable, and easy for the Collector to use.

FIS Lending Solutions has developed this interactive, private-labeled Internet site to provide users with the tools and information necessary to research and apply for a mortgage, home equity loan, HELOC, automobile loan, personal loan, or credit card independently or with access to lender support personnel as needed. Borrowers are flocking to the web from a variety of devices - to conduct their research and originate applications.FIS understands the need for Financial Institutions to create a secure, branded web presence to capture the business of the online users and compete with the influence of direct banks. FIS also recognizes how intimidating the loan origination process especially the mortgage process can be to borrowers. The Internet Direct website solution not only meets but exceeds the user's expectations for ease-of-use and availability of the right information, educational materials, and loan tools. FIS has designed all functions to enhance the users experience and satisfaction with originating a loan application online.At the same time, Internet Direct improves the lenders operating results, using fewer resources to gain more business. Internet Direct provides a loan application solution that can be used by branch personnel, personal bankers, and other less experienced loan originators within the Financial Institution. This leads to less reliance on paper applications and manual re-keying of data, and provides consistency in the loan origination process across channels. The Internet Direct website incorporates all the services a user needs to make their financing decisions. This design promotes visitor retention by eliminating the need for the user to shop elsewhere for services. The website supports point-of-sale decisioning all products. It intuitively guides the user through the application process while they complete a full loan application. For mortgage applications it can enable the user to select an interest rate/point combination as the basis for their loan request. For equity, consumer, and credit card applications, a conditional decision and rate can be provided to the applicant based on the Financial Institutions credit policy and current rates. Internet Direct can retrieve a users credit report and automatically merge liabilities from the report with the application. The lender determines whether a submitted application goes to: Lender only (lender can download DU, MISMO XML, Credit Card XML, or Consumer XML files). FIS's Loan Origination Studio (LOS), if the lender also has that application. LOS continues management of loan applications through to closing. Fidelity Loan Origination (FLO), if the lender also has that application. FLO continues management of loan applications through to closing.  A non-FIS core or documentation system.

9698,Applications,TellerReserve,"By implementing HORIZONs TellerReserve from FIS, the teller line stays open even when the financial institutions network is down. TellerReserve is a PC-based application perfectly integrated with HORIZON Teller. While the network is online, the TellerReserve application runs silently in the background, synchronizing system data, cash drawer totals and teller transactions. Your network is constantly monitored for connectivity. In todays competitive environment, a bank cant afford to have your teller line unavailable to service customers quickly and accurately. Due to unforeseen events or network failures, communications cant always be established. If connectivity is lost to a branch or a key location, it is critical for a financial institution to be able to continue to their customers.   When TellerReserve detects that the host system is unavailable, it launches automatically, allowing tellers to continue seamlessly processing transactions without any negative impact to customers. Gone are the days in which a customer hears the words sorry, our system is down right now. Once connectivity is restored, TellerReserve automatically migrates all offline transactions into HORIZON Teller. In other words, TellerReserve is a contingency plan that protects a financial institution against unexpected network outages.",965,"Alison Moncrief,Amisha Chauhan",Sundown,Regional and Community Banking Solutions,Horizon,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

15439	Services	Dynamic Currency Conversion	Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) provides additional fee income for ATM acquiring owners. Fees for foreign cardholder paid to the acquiring ATM owner are typically in the range of 8-10% of the transaction value. This helps the ATM owner pay for their ATM asset by charging an exchange rate to visiting foreign cardholders that withdrawal US dollars from ATM's in the United States. FIS will only support for ISO Retail ATMs from ATM vendors Hyosung and Genmega initially in 2021. We will continue to consider DCC as a candidate for expansion to financial institution ATMs in 2022+ roadmaps but nothing currently planned. Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) occurs at acquiring ATMs located in the United States (US) when an international cardholder makes a cash withdrawal in US Dollars (USD). At DCC enabled ATMs, the international cardholder is presented with the withdrawal amount in their home currency prior to the transaction being completed. When DCC is utilized, an international cardholder will be presented with the option to: 1) accept the amount presented to the cardholder in their home currency, or 2) decline the amount presented, in which case the transaction will proceed without the cardholder knowing the exchange rate in a non-DCC flow. The current flow includes currency conversion fees assessed by the associations and issuers. Within the DCC model, currency conversion fees are assessed on the acquirer side with revenue split between the ATM Acquirer (Owner), FIS, and our software partner Planet Payment. This represents an additional revenue stream not currently available for FIS ATM Acquirers	2141	Andrew Oasen	Active	Regional and Community Banking Solutions	Miser	2023-06-22	NULL	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	NULL

15633	Products	Modern Banking Platform	Modern Banking Platform, the next generation, core banking platform, is designed to meet the unique challenges and opportunities of the digital age. The solution design embraces three essential attributes: Component based. All components are self-contained and developed individually to key standards. You can maintain and change anything where and when you want to, without affecting other core components. This approach enables infinite institution-specific personalization through configurations rather than coding, enabling your bank to be more nimble and responsive. Changes are implemented using small agile teams, ensuring cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. API first. All of FIS market-leading core components can be exposed as application program interfaces (APIs) to be consumed by the bank and third-party applications. With the FIS open platform, you can support new business models and respond to evolving customer needs quickly and easily.

15723	Applications	ABM - Auto Boot Monitor	The Auto Boot Monitor (ABM) solution is a Windows Service which monitors Prophet Enterprise (PE) Active Jobs and PE Machine Statuses to ensure that each PE Job has the resources it requires. The ABM service will start Azure VMs or AWS EC2 Instances when there aren't enough online machine resources available for a job to prepare or run. The service calculates each job's machine resource requirements based on the Preparation and Runtime Minimum Resources settings as well as the number of logical cores on each machine.  The ABM service doesn't use the Maximum Resources settings. However, Maximum could be set to a value higher than Minimum to allow the PE Scheduler to scale-out the job to any available online machines. If you are not concerned with job scale-out, it is recommended to set both Minimum and Maximum to the same value. In addition to automated booting of VMs/Instances, the ABM service also checks for idle machines and stops them, which helps lower billable cloud compute hours. The service will de-allocate Azure VMs that have been idle for longer than 7 minutes. Configuring this timeout to a higher or lower value is possible. AWS EC2 instances will be stopped just before the next billable hour.	12891	Oscar Weafer	Active	Treasury and Risk	Risk Management	2023-06-22	NULL	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP	2023-06-22 04:10:03.417	NULL

14544,Products,FIS Compliance Reporting Manager,"The consolidated audit trail (CAT) is potentially the largest data collection exercise in the history of the U.S. markets. The regulation is over 5+ years in the making and was spurred by the events of the Flash Crash in May of 2010 when in a matter of minutes the markets dropped and regained 1000 points, an unprecedented event in Wall St history. In response, on July 11, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to adopt Rule 613 under Regulation NMS requiring the national securities exchanges and national securities associations (collectively, the SROs) to submit an NMS plan (Plan) to the SEC to create, implement, and maintain CAT. The purpose of the CAT is to track orders throughout their entire life cycle and identify the broker-dealers handling and underlying client, thus allowing regulators to more efficiently track activity in eligible securities throughout the U.S. markets. The primary goal of Rule 613 (the Rule) is to improve the ability of the SEC and the SROs to oversee trading in the U.S. securities markets, initially covering stock and option activity. To achieve this goal the Rule requires all broker-dealers and exchanges to submit all trading data, quoting data, allocation data and customer information daily to the CAT Processor. When complete, the CAT will be the world's largest data repository for securities transactions tracking approximately 58 billion records daily. The Protegent CAT solution will help broker dealers comply with the regulation, but that's just the beginning. Protegent CAT will also provide access to an unprecedented consolidated data set. The solution will include: Data normalization, consolidation and validation processes that account for multiple disparate data feeds, On-demand user tools designed to review and visualize the data processing of CAT reportable events, Pre- and post-submission error correction capabilities designed to limit or eliminate errors in CAT data, thus potentially reducing regulatory inquiries, User tools designed to manage/update Customer Account information, WORM-compliant archiving as required pursuant to the SEC's Books and Records requirements, Surveillance reports designed to analyze the CAT submission to identify manipulative behaviors and other volatile order handling practices.",0,Anthony Becker,Active,Trading and Processing,Protegent,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

The ATM Surcharge Rebate module is a separately licensed feature of the HORIZON solution, and it works in tandem with processing options in HORIZON and the FIS EFT solution. Features  Surcharge identification  The FIS InterCept EFT solution identifies and stores the amount of the surcharge as transactions are passed from the EFT networks into HORIZON. The surcharge rebate credit is automatically generated, according to bank-defined rules, to the cardholders account on the same processing day that the ATM withdrawal is posted.   Control options  You can define surcharge rebate rules for the number of transactions and/or a maximum dollar amount paid per statement cycle. For example, a marketing program can be developed to offer five rebated transactions and/or a maximum of $20.00 worth of rebates within the accounts statement cycle.  Integration with Conditional Rate Processing  Surcharge rebates can occur as soon as the ATM withdrawal is posted, or they can be accumulated to be used in conjunction with the Conditional Rate Processing module in HORIZON. When linking ATM surcharge rebates with conditional rate processing, your customers must meet certain criteria in order to qualify for a higher interest rate and receive the surcharge rebate.

PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring provides the likelihood that an on-going consumer customer will pay their current outstanding obligations over the near future, typically next 6 months, in a severely delinquent manner or not at all and the Cash at Risk (CAR) for that consumer given this prediction of severe delinquency or no payment. With this predictive intelligence businesses can allocate their scarce collection resources over their large portfolio of accounts; what accounts to act upon, what accounts can wait, as well as determine the type, e.g. email or call, and degree, e.g. reminder call or demanding call. Businesses also can use the collection risk assessment as input to regulatory filings, new order release or credit line changes and use CAR as input to loss reserve modeling To obtain PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring a business first needs to provide historical data as called for from our detailed data request. The data necessary for PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring is available from any account receivable system. Once PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring has been calibrated to the payment behavior of the businesss customers than ongoing month end data is necessary to update the collection scoring to reflect their customers most recent behavior.

A seemingly innocent profile-change request is followed by a request for a debit card or other payment instrument by the criminal. Profile changes can negatively affect institutions in the following ways:  Fraud losses: Nearly 2 percent of all profile changes are fraudulent. (Javelin, 2018). ATO losses are projected to increase by 43% by the year 2020. (Javelin, 2017), High compliance costs: Many financial institutions still rely on costly notification letters as a control for customer-related profile changes. This is largely driven by a compliance requirement contained within the FACT Act Red Flag legislation (Section 114b), Operational inefficiencies: The profile-information change process at many financial institutions is often costly and labor-intensive. The primary drivers of these inefficiencies are compliance practices (described above), returned mail handling, manual correction efforts, and resulting customer friction.  Solution - Screen all profile changes with FraudChex to confirm their legitimacy.  The FraudChex platform helps ensure that customer address, phone number, and email address changes are valid, accurate and safe, rather than a setup for account takeover.  How it Works - Profile changes are sent via batch or real-time to the FraudChex platform, FraudChex-ATO examines hundreds of profile-related and identity-focused data attributes seeking out-of-pattern behavior,  The profile change is assigned a fraud risk score, The score and information on suspicious behavior are sent to the online case-management system, allowing investigators to quickly stop criminal activity before it becomes costly.",0,Nick White,Active,Decision Solutions,Decision Solutions,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

The system processes transactions entered online in a real-time environment, updating the database immediately to reflect the transaction while simultaneously validating all transactions during data entry. When tellers post transactions in Profile, the system checks for restrictions on all accounts entered on the posting screen, rejecting the entire set of transaction if a restriction is detected. FIS Profile enables users to override restrictions on customer accounts, which can be limited by an organization to separate authorized user privileges based on the user's authorization clearance level. Profile Teller also allows an organization to determine overrides and/or restrictions based on the transaction code in use. Profile Teller enables the organization to track the balance (of all currencies) currently in a teller's drawer. Profile aids tellers in tracking documents generated or collected during transaction processing, periodically generating lists for each type of document, and forwarding the documents and lists to the organization's proof department for reconcilement purposes. FIS Profile fully supports both teller balancing and branch processing by monitoring the total cash amount as users post transactions.

4556,Applications,GN - Architecture System,"Systematics Architecture  Introduction  A financial services organization must react to competition and changing customer needs with flexible products and services, maintain the customer and account data in an efficient, cost-effective, and accurate manner, and cost-justify technology investments. The Core Account Management domain of applications helps financial services organizations meet these requirements by providing the following: High volume, efficient processing  The high-volume transactions of core processing, such as, loans and deposits, are serviced with high functionality.  Low volume, function-rich processing  The low-volume, functionally complex transactions, such as, those of fee-based services, are processed with the same cost effectiveness as is provided to high-volume processing applications.  Low transaction costs  High-volume transactions are processed with high functionality and a resulting low cost relative to the volume of transactions processed. The combination of high volumes and rich functionality, with resulting low transaction costs, allows banks to provide extensive low-cost services to customers.  Data of record  The Systematics applications house most of the data of record.  Centralized data integrity and control  Data integrity and control are key concerns in a processing environment. To achieve effective data control and integrity, the Systematics applications provide a centralized data housing and verification.    The Core Account Management domain is comprised of applications that support the actual products and services provided by financial services providers to their customers. The family name of the application architecture described within this document is Systematics. The central point of the Systematics architecture is the Customer Information Management function. The Customer Information Management layer stores customer data and relationships in a central processing location. This central repository of customer data provides valuable information that allows users to improve ways to sell products, manage customer relationships, and increase profitability. The Customer Information Management layer contains data about customers, such as, name and address information and relationships among customers and accounts. In summary, the Systematics applications support core account processing functions, acting as the servers to requests controlled by the service management and information management domains.Concepts The application concepts used by FIS to develop Systematics applications include principles, quality attributes, techniques, features, and metrics. Within the context of architecture, we use the following definitions: Principles  Comprehensive and fundamental rules that are future-oriented and intended to deal with known and knowable, and unknown and unknowable conditions. Principles provide guidance in establishing priorities and trade-offs that are of wide applicability. Quality attributes  Superior and essential characteristics of architecture. Techniques  Analysis and construction, process, and execution rules used during the development, enhancement, execution, and maintenance of a system. Features  Prominent parts, characteristics, or functions for which a system is specifically fitted or used. Metrics  Tangible measurements used to determine if specific rules (i.e., techniques) are followed or specific goals (i.e., quality attributes, principles) are met.   Principles The overarching technical principles followed by FIS are Insulation from changing environments  The insulation of application components is the most basic and most important architectural concept. In todays dynamic technology environment, it is difficult or impossible to accurately predict even short-term changes, making proper insulation of applications more important than ever. By isolating system components from the environment in which they run, the effect of changes in the environment on applications is minimized. This increases the flexibility and life span of applications while reducing the expense of maintaining them over time. Reuse  Developers have struggled for years with the problems of inconsistent implementation of identical system components and the difficulties and expense of maintaining redundant code. The solution to these problems appears to be in code that is designed for sharing among multiple applications and platforms  reuse. FIS recognizes the value of sharing components and promotes their use at all levels of system implementations. Reuse makes sense because the similarity found across software systems is undeniable. When we compare software systems, we usually find sixty-to-seventy percent commonality from one software application to another. This includes code, design, functional, and architectural similarities. At all levels of development, from requirements specifications to code, there are components that by the nature of implementing tasks and representing information on a computer must appear over and over again in software applications. Currently, FIS focuses on software reuse (the process of using pre-defined software routines) and shared architecture to achieve increased productivity, shortened software development time, improved software system interoperability, and more standardized software. Open applications  Open systems are an important trend in todays technology environment; however, the underlying need is for open applications. In todays business environment, with increasing merger and acquisition activities, heterogeneous computing environments have become a common occurrence. These heterogeneous environments create an increasing need for open applications. The development of open applications, using defined APIs and standard formats, allows integration between FIS application components, as well as allowing integration with third-party applications.   Quality Attributes The quality attributes that FIS believes should be inherent in a robust architecture for the financial industry are as follows:   Usability  A set of attributes that bears on the effort needed for use and on the individual assessment of such use by a stated or implied set of users. This quality attribute encompasses 24x7x365 availability, real-time processing, distributed customers and accounts, distributed processing, one system of record, security, performance requirements, etc.  Scalability  The solution must be able to handle processing when the size changes.  Portability/Flexibility  Components must be easily adapted for use in applications or environments other than those for which they were specifically designed.  Interoperability  The solution must interact with other solutions to exchange information and to mutually use the exchanged information.  Adaptability/Extensibility  The solution can be modified to meet new requirements including the satisfaction of differing system constraints and user needs.  Reliability  The solution must detect and correct or respond to errors appropriately in the software, hardware, and data environments in which it must operate.  Maintainability  The solution must manifest ease in correcting recognized inadequacies; it must cost-effectively allow perfective, adaptive, and corrective changes for uncovered defects or changes/upgrades to system function.  Reusability  Where possible, components must be built that can be used in more than one software system, or in building other components, with little or no adaptation.   Techniques To ensure manifestation of architectural principles in application development, several standard techniques are employed. These include:  Interaction layers  Software layering  Parameter-driven software  Defined interfaces  User exits  Shared components  Modularity  Centralized data definition.   Interaction Layers Interaction layers insulate applications from the surrounding environment so they can be easily adapted for use in environments other than those for which they were specifically designed. This technique promotes portability/flexibility. There are two types of interaction layers:  Local Logical Interaction  These layers exist to insulate applications from the architecture and shared components.   Vendor Logical Interaction  These layers exist to insulate applications from vendor environments (e.g., operating systems, database implementation, etc.).   The SYSTEMATICS architecture facilitates the insulation of applications from differences in operating systems, batch versus online, communication protocols, physical data representation, third-party software, and prior releases of SYSTEMATICS applications.   Software Layering The SYSTEMATICS application architecture uses the idea of logical layering to separate the presentation of data, the business functions of an application, and the storage and management of data.  The model shown in Figure 1 shows a three-tier architecture. While this term has become popular with client/server implementation, the idea predates client/server, and FIS has employed this layering technique for many years. The Presentation Layer contains the user interface of the applications. Whether a non-programmable terminal or Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used, the same basic components are present. The Business Logic is the discrete components of the application's logic that can operate independently from Presentation and Data Access. Regardless of the input source or how the data is stored, these functions operate the same. The Data Access layer contains the logic and processes necessary to store and manipulate the data. Industry experts agree that an essential element of an adaptive architecture is that the business and technology implementations are insulated from the physical environment through software layering. Parameter-Driven Software Todays business environment has rapidly changing business needs, creating the need to change systems without coding. The development and use of parameterized software provides a greater ability to respond to changing business requirements without changing or writing code. Parameter-driven software gives us the ability to develop new products quickly, reduce custom code, and lower software maintenance costs. Parameterized software is not sufficient in itself; the parameters must be organizationally driven. Parameterization of application software provides sufficient flexibility to reflect organizational structures. Financial services organizations can customize a data processing system to reflect its current business and operational requirements by assigning values for processing parameters. Parameterization will guide system processing by managing the assigned control information. Since its beginning, the SYSTEMATICS application architecture has promoted the use of parameters. Defined Interfaces As the FIS software has evolved and matured, key principles were learned and carried forward. Three of these key lessons were: 1) FIS applications must communicate with each other, 2) FIS applications must communicate with non-FIS applications, and 3) this communication must have the capability of crossing multiple and diverse platforms. The SYSTEMATICS architecture provides for interfaces as follows: Inter-Application CommunicationBatch File Interfaces  The FIS applications are distributed with programs to create and accept batch input files (e.g., Customer Information System (CIS), statement, and relationship pricing processing, NSF/OD processing, automated balancing, online, transaction warehouse systems, etc.). A General Ledger interface parameter file is also provided. Intra-System CommunicationOnline Message-based Processing  The TS Delivery (TS) system is structured to isolate message processing from business rules and logic. This structure allows the communication with different and multiple platforms without affecting the business processing of an application. Messaging has been developed for LU6.2 (APPC), teller terminal software, TCP/IP, and MQSeries.  User Exits The development and maintenance of custom code is costly, difficult, and unproductive  and greatly reduced through user exits. User exits, which are planned carefully in advance, provide non-invasive changes, lowered costs, and extensibility of applications. SYSTEMATICS applications have employed user exits effectively and efficiently for years and will continue to do so. Shared Components The reuse of code and resulting productivity gains  less future code written, greater stability in given applications, shorter development times, and lower application development and maintenance costs  all support immediate use of shared components. Code designed for sharing among multiple applications and platforms not only provides increased productivity, but also promotes consistent implementations and increased application quality.  FIS has implemented the concept of shared components as follows:  Standard subroutines  Common types of application processing are separated into subroutines for developers to use as needed. Examples of these common processes include date routines, standard edits, operational functions, and reporting device interfaces.  Common source  Our standards require that code be developed in a way that allows specific code and entire applications to operate across platforms (e.g., batch/online, Z/OS, and VSE.). This is achieved by insulating environment specific functions (e.g., interface, input functions, and output functions) from business logic.    Modularity In a principle related to the use of shared components, the SYSTEMATICS applications use modularity to reduce high maintenance costs and improve productivity.  Modularity provides systems that are more flexible, allows a mix-and-match approach to application development, and promotes the reuse of code with its resulting improvements to quality and productivity. Centralized Data Definition The SYSTEMATICS applications use a data dictionary for centralized data definition. Without the use of a centralized data dictionary, the same data is often defined in different ways. Varying data definitions not only allow inconsistent appearances of data, but they can facilitate programming errors. Centralized data definition provides a consistent use of data and results in reduced programming errors.

10211,Applications,Teller Capture (TPIII),"HORIZON Teller Capture from FIS provides financial institutions with the ability to perform image capture and transaction balancing at the teller station. Tellers accept checks and deposit slips and run them through a scanner, which instantly extracts the deposit account number from the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) data. .As each check is processed through the reader, the system applies highly optimized courtesy and legal amount recognition, so the teller almost never keys in the check amount. Our solution matches the unique MICR of every check with its given amount, adds the value of all checks presented and makes sure it corresponds with the total deposit on the deposit slip. The Teller Capture solution automates the creation of virtual tickets for non-scanned items, such as cash-in and cash-out tickets.   The Teller Capture solution provides your institution with the capability to image capture checks at the teller station, extending backroom capture and balancing into the branch. With the Teller Capture solution, your teller staff will combine traditional online teller transaction processing with check image capture and transaction balancing. The Teller Capture solution can be deployed as a stand-alone solution or as a strategic component of an enterprise-wide distributed capture infrastructure. When paired with Branch Capture, it provides optimum teller efficiency by serving low-volume retail customers at the teller line as well as high-volume merchants and corporate customers at the back counter. The Teller Capture solution performs Dynamic Reject Entry Automation Module    (DREAM) technology on all check images at capture. DREAM automatically repairs the MICR line of the checks in real time and returns them to the normal processing stream in less than a second. The DREAM solution automatically corrects such a high percentage of rejects that financial institutions realize a significant reduction in the time spent repairing rejects and correcting out-of-balance batches.",965,"Alison Moncrief,Amisha Chauhan",Active,Regional and Community Banking Solutions,Horizon,6/22/2023,NULL,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,FNFIS\SVCACCTCIOODP,10:03.4,NULL

With this predictive intelligence businesses can allocate their scarce collection resources over their large portfolio of accounts; what accounts to act upon, what accounts can wait, as well as determine the type, e.g. email or call, and degree, e.g. reminder call or demanding call. Businesses also can use the collection risk assessment as input to new order release or credit line changes and use CAR as input to loss reserve modeling. To obtain PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring a business first needs to provide historical data as called for from our detailed data request. The data necessary for PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring is available from any account receivable system. Once PredictiveMetrics Collection Scoring has been calibrated to the payment behavior of the business's customers, then ongoing month end data is necessary to update the collection scoring to reflect their customers' most recent behavior.

It is built for multi-tenancy and white-labeling. Its purpose is to accelerate the development of screens by providing features and components that are common to many applications, allowing developers to declaratively invoke rich-client functionality in HTML with a minimum of coding. The open, collaborative model that encourages contribution from consuming lines of business allows the framework to grow and evolve with business needs, as well as continually expand the features and components available for re-use. At the same time, using the framework's components and application shells ensure that company branding is adhered to, and that applications built by different, independent teams within the company look and behave in a similar manner, and integrate well with each other (from a visual perspective).RUF is strictly a presentation layer. It contains no back-end services and does not rely on any particular back-end technology (i.e. Java, .NET or any other programming language), so it can be used with your existing back-end provided that you follow some conventions for client-server communication (it supports any back-end technology that delivers JSON via HTTP-based RESTful services). New components are added on an as-needed basis, based on consuming project requirements and priorities. The core development team will continually adjust testing on multiple browsers based on market demand and popular support.RUF also provides tooling and development platform for aiding developers in building user interfaces using the framework. The framework is modular, so teams can pick and choose which components they wish to use. The components are responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices. RUF components support Internationalization, they are accessible and work well with RTL (right-to-left) languages.All the components closely follow FIS UX Styleguide for styling and UX and are themeable which means each application can configure a theme of their own and the components will adjust accordingly.RUF is based on Angular, a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. RUF also provides styling for the Angular Material 2 component library. It brings its components in line with the FIS UX Guidelines.
